　　唱歌与跳舞是人类进行艺术文明娱乐的方式之一。在树下唱歌与跳舞让许多民族充满智慧与灵秀。俄罗斯民族的许多优秀民谣和歌舞是在白桦树下再现的；中华民族的许多民谣歌舞乃至诗赋大都离不开“树”。从民歌《小河淌水》到古诗“月上柳梢头，人约黄昏后”，都可以感受到那种在树下的美好意境。可以想见，在树下唱歌与舞蹈会使我们尽情地敞开自己，澄明自己。我们会真切地感受到心中的歌舞之树常绿常青。哪怕我们一个人独自在树下歌唱或舞蹈，也不会感到空虚和落寞。
临近开学，父亲卖了两千斤玉茭和十个猪仔。父亲说，去吧，省得以后后悔。
站在左右的大伯端起那盘货色叫咱们吃点，我猎奇地拿起一个咬了一口，内里是精致的蜂窝状，一丝焦香酥脆绵甜的味道顺着我的舌头赶快曼延至浑身，哇，几乎太好吃了!我一面吃一面在内心暗背地赞叹。
When I was a child, the family was very poor, no money to read.
I had only one year, returned home to help his father to do farm work.
Cattle, ducks, farming, etc. I have done.
I feel life is too hard, I know only reading KaoXue can jump.
At 19 years old, my mother gave birth to a son.
I secretly swear: I again painstakingly again tired, also want to raise my younger brother.
Any farm work so I don't brother, as long as he is reading.
But he never admitted to high school.
I borrowed some money, find a lot of people send him into the county no.1 middle school reading.
At four o 'clock in the morning in the street, a slim figure, hurried stopped a taxi.
Squatting nearby, a child, looked very miserable.
The thin, she ran to the child, demanding the baby on the car, passing by, saw she trembled.
